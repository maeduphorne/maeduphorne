### Howdy ü§†

I'm Mae Duphorne - a former fine-dining Event Manager turned Software Engineer. I'm currently studying at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) with an anticipated completion date of _November 2021_. My extensive background in the restaurant industry has taught me to problem solve quickly and consistently and I can't wait to see what my "make it work" attitude will bring to life when combined with my skills in software development.
